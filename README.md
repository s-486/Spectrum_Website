<b>SPECTRUM</b> is so named as it provides us with different wings emitted by the hardwork from our members, showing homologous transitions between Hardware, Software and Designing. The HARDWARE team of the Club mainly focuses on VLSI, Embedded Systems and PCB Design. We have developed many projects with implementation and testing of circuits, components, systems, etc. The SOFTWARE team is continuously striving for growth in the domains of Web Development, App Development, Competitive Programming, Machine Learning and Data Science. Working as a team, inspiring each other we quickly develop viable solutions for a better outcome. The DESIGN Wing of our Club has proven their creativity in UI/UX Poster Designing. We believe visual communication is a major tool to enhance various creative projects.
